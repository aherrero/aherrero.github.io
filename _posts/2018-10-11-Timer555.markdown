## Introduction
I've remember when I learn about oscillators,  multivibrators and so on, it wasn't very comfortable at all..

[Astable Multivibrator tutorial](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/waveforms/astable.html)

But then, I've heard how the people of hackaday talks about the Timer 555 (TODO link) as references in sentences like "An Arduino for that?? I could use a 555 and it will better than your project" so, I've decided to investigate.

## What is the timer 555
The [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC) says:
_The 555 timer IC is an integrated circuit (chip) used in a variety of timer, pulse generation, and oscillator applications. The 555 can be used to provide time delays, as an oscillator, and as a flip-flop element._

The IC 555 has three operating modes: Astable, Monostable and Bistable.

You can read the datasheet from [TI](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ne555.pdf)

## How to use it
This [tutorial](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/waveforms/555_timer.html) includes good examples about how to use the timer 555 even if there are hundreds of examples.

On the other hand, the [http://www.555-timer-circuits.com/](http://www.555-timer-circuits.com/) page describes everything we want to know about this little thing.

## Basic Astable 555 Oscillator Circuit
We are going to builg a basic astable with the timer 555. For that, I have two references:
- [Tutorial to see the layout](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/waveforms/555_oscillator.html)
- [Calculator for passive components in relation with frequency](http://www.ohmslawcalculator.com/555-astable-calculator)

Following the formules,

and
![tim50.gif](/assets/tmr02/tim50.gif)

and also with the [calculator](http://www.ohmslawcalculator.com/555-astable-calculator), we can calculate the passive components that we want for our cycle.

In this case, for a cycle high and low around 350ms, I choose the component:
C = 100uF
R1 = 1k
R2 = 4.7K
