## Introduction
I've remember when I learned about oscillators,  multivibrators, flip-flop and so on in the university, it wasn't pleasant at all..

Example of what horrified me:

[Astable Multivibrator tutorial](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/waveforms/astable.html)

But then, I've heard how the people of [hackaday](https://hackaday.com/?s=555) talks about the [Timer 555](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9273) as a reference in sentences like:

_"An Arduino for that?? I could use a 555 and it will better than your project"_

So, I've decided to investigate.

## What is the timer 555
The [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC) says:

_The 555 timer IC is an integrated circuit (chip) used in a variety of timer, pulse generation, and oscillator applications. The 555 can be used to provide time delays, as an oscillator, and as a flip-flop element._

In other worlds, it is a small chip, not at all expensive, and very old in the market (From 1970!) but very used in all kind of applications.

The IC 555 has three operating modes: Astable, Monostable and Bistable.

You can read the datasheet from [Texas Instruments](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ne555.pdf)

## How to use it
This [tutorial](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/waveforms/555_timer.html) includes good examples about how to use the timer 555 even if there are hundreds of examples.

On the other hand, the [http://www.555-timer-circuits.com/](http://www.555-timer-circuits.com/) page describes everything we want to know about this little thing.

And of course, the [tutorials from sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2007) can't miss.

## Basic Astable 555 Oscillator Circuit
We are going to build a basic astable with the timer 555. For that, I have two references:
- [Tutorial to see the layout](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/waveforms/555_oscillator.html)
- [Calculator for passive components in relation with frequency](http://www.ohmslawcalculator.com/555-astable-calculator)

This is a basic layout:

![tim47.gif](/assets/tmr02/tim47.gif)

And the formules to calculate the passive components in function of how much frequency, duty cycle etc, you want

![tim49.gif](/assets/tmr02/tim49.gif)

![tim50.gif](/assets/tmr02/tim50.gif)

With this [calculator](http://www.ohmslawcalculator.com/555-astable-calculator), we can calculate the passive components that we want for our cycle.

In this case, for a cycle high and low around **350ms each**, I choose the components:
- C = 100uF
- R1 = 1k
- R2 = 4.7K

- One of the [smallest blinking circuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffbmwlk_9Io) I see, which I will try soon..
- In [555-timer-circuits](http://www.555-timer-circuits.com/) you will find several examples.
