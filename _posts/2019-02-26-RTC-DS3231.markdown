## Quick Testing RTC DS3231

In the past, I was using a simple oscillator to measure the time. This is not the best way, ant even worst if the oscillator is 8MHz from the microcontroller (Losing seconds every day!)

Then, an oscillator with the frequency 32.768kHz improve the measure. 32.768 kHz it is precisely half of a 16-bit counter. Start counting at 0x8000 (or 32768). When the counter rolls over from 65535 to 0, then you know that exactly one second has passed.

After that, I tried a RTC with the oscillator 32.768. In this way, I am no worries about how to count the seconds with the microcontroller, a dedicated chip measure the time for me. I've tried the [RTC MCP79410-I/SN SO-8](https://www.distrelec.ch/en/rtc-ic-so-microchip-mcp79410-sn/p/17380943).

It is not so bad, but is necessary an external oscillator.

In this test, I am going to use the [DS3231](https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Maxim-Integrated/DS3231SN?qs=1eQvB6Dk1vhUlr8%2FOrV0Fw==)

The  DS3231  is  a  extremely  accurate  I2C real-time  clock  (RTC)  with  an  integrated  temperature-compensated   crystal   oscillator   (TCXO)   and   crystal.   The  device  incorporates  a  battery  input,  and  maintains  accurate  timekeeping  when  main  power  to  the  device  is  interrupted.  The  integration  of  the  crystal  resonator  enhances  the  long-term  accuracy  of  the  device  as  well  as  reduces  the  piece-part  count  in  a  manufacturing  line.

## Price
I've consider is quite expensive (~8e), compare with others RTC (Although, it is more precise, oscillator integrated and temperature sensor for compensation...) but, as always, you can buy in [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Real-Time-Clock-chip-10PCS-DS3231SN-DS3231-16-SOIC/32837219361.html?spm=a2g0y.10010108.1000001.8.1c1e56388z8bpw) for much less.

## Schematic and layout
Adafruit has a [breakout pcb](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ds3231-precision-rtc-breakout/arduino-usage) for this component and they have also the component for eagle in their [library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Eagle-Library) if you decide to build your own system.

## Pinout
You can find the pinout in the official [datasheet](https://eu.mouser.com/datasheet/2/256/DS3231-1513891.pdf),

And an [example](https://simple-circuit.com/pic16f877a-ds3231-rtc-set-buttons/) with the tyipical values for the component for using with a pic microcontroller

## Software
There are several libraries using this RTC for arduino (or for the atmega328), but this library from [Makuna](https://github.com/Makuna/Rtc/wiki) seems to be very simple and updated.

Another library for complex (or complete) is this one [JChristensen](https://github.com/JChristensen/DS3232RTC) or the one from [adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib)
