## Introduction

This is a quick post about how I tried to replace the screen from a Samsung A5 2017.

And I said I tried because, although the result was fine, I lost a button in the path...

## Tutorial
I've followed these two videos:

## Process

I've bought the screen in [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/For-Samsung-Galaxy-A5-2017-A520F-SM-A520F-A520-LCD-Display-Touch-Screen-Digitizer-Glass-Assembly/32961909345.html). For $30 you can buy a screen, so I've decided to give a try.

The screen came in this protected box,

The smartphone in the previous status,

The first step is removing the back cover,

Then all the screws for removing the protection of the electronics,

Disconnect the two cables, battery and screen,

Remove the screen **carefully**

If you don't remove the screen carefully, you have the risk to cut some cable.. In this case, the cable for the right button (And it is a difficult solution if you don't have a spare cable, so, I decided to continue..)

Put the new screen,

Connect the batter cable, the screen cable and screw all the screws back

Et voil√†! The screen is working correctly,

We could see how the right button is not illuminated and obviously, it's not working

Here the old screen,

## Conclusion
The process to replace a screen, at least if it is the first time, it's kind if tricky. You have to be careful with the hot gun and also removing the screen and cover.

The screen I bought, 30$ in aliexpress, seems not be the best screen in the market. The luminosity is less in the screen and also, it seems there is a delay (micro seconds) more than the original screen. Maybe the chip of the screen is also cheap.. So I would not recommend this screen.
