This blog has been born with the idea to document everything I do as personal project, as a way to remember how I did all these projects. The first intention, therefore, is the documentation for myself, but if it is useful for other people, they are very good news.

Electronic engineering as studies and software engineer as profession, I feel interest in embedded devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded software for microcontrollers, so I build some projects I like and some that could improve my life.
